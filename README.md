# TEST Slideshow
Hello, I am a developer who practices to create random things. This is a automatic slideshow that can run on pretty much any older iPad. Its almost like one of those Nixplay picture frames. I am practicing to learn how make one so PLEASE be patient if there are bugs, also let me know if there are any bugs and I will have hotfixes every too weeks. It is difficult to import photos but I am trying to find a more efficent way of doing that. -Ddawg
