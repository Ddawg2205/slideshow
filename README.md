# TEST Slideshow
Hello, I am a developer who practices to create random things.

This is a automatic slideshow that can run on pretty much on any device depending on what is says in my version list. Its almost like one of those Nixplay picture frames. I am practicing to learn how make one so PLEASE be patient if there are bugs. Also let me know if there are any bugs and I will try my best to fix them. It is difficult to import photos but I am trying to find a more efficent way of doing that.
